# Placeholder Audio Files

This directory should contain the following audio files:
- music.mp3 (background music)
- success.mp3 (success sound effect)
- fail.mp3 (fail sound effect)
- explosion.mp3 (explosion/celebration sound effect)

Since we cannot generate actual audio files, the application will gracefully handle missing audio files without crashing.
